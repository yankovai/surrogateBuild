What does this code do?

Scientifc computer codes attempt to predict some physical phenomenon. The computer codes take a bunch of inputs, plug them into differential equations as parameters, and then solve the differential equations to hopefully obtain some representation of something of interest. Most of these computer codes have many inputs, or are "high dimensional". Further, many of the inputs have uncertainties associated with them. This is especially true if the inputs are derived from experimental data.

This code seeks to create surrogate models for computer codes based on cut-HDMR decompositions along with Smolyak sparse grid interpolation.
